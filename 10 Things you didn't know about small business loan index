EMI, also known as Equated Monthly Instalment, is a type of fixed payment, which you will have to pay in the first week of the month.

8.	Online lenders are not a good option 
When the other options fail, most people usually opt for online lenders for loan purposes. While they generally provide funding lot more quickly than others, their terms and conditions, regarding small business loan index, are known to be quite weak. Besides, they also do ask for a high percentage of interest. 

9.	The more the money, the higher the interest 
 In most cases, if you have applied for a higher amount of capital, then you would have to pay a lot more interest than usual. It is evident in the cases of both smaller as well as bigger banks.   

10.	Learn from Rejections 
If you are a small business owner and are applying for loans everywhere, then it is a no brainer that you will get rejected for the first few times. So, instead of feeling down about it, you would need to learn more from your mistakes.
